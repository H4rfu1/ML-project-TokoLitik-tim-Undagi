1. This directory contains .ipnyb programs and json file in order to predict monthly sales of TokoLitik project. Yet, it's still under development. Programs flow explanation:
- CrawlToped.ipynb -> crawl dataset product reviews at Tokopedia platform.
- DatasetPreparationAndLabelling.ipynb -> process labelling dataset.

2. I plan to do the following in the next commit:
- Update cleaned dataset change acronim word.
